# Quiver

This repository introduces and defines a specialized file format known as a **Quiver file**. A Quiver file acts as a container that consolidates the contents of many individual files into a single, structured file. Each piece of data within a Quiver file is referred to as an **entry**, and every entry is uniquely identified by a name. Along with the actual file contents, each entry can also include **metadata**, such as file size, timestamps, tags, or other descriptive information relevant to the entry. This format enables efficient storage, organization, and retrieval of a large number of related files within a single archive-like structure.

In addition to the file format itself, this repository provides a suite of **command-line tools** designed to interact with and manipulate Quiver files. These tools are built with a composable design philosophy in mind, meaning they are intended to be **pipe-able** and easily combined in Unix-style workflows. This allows users to construct complex data manipulation pipelines by chaining together simple commands, making the tools flexible and script-friendly.

The concept and implementation of Quiver files and their associated tools are **heavily inspired by Brian Coventryâ€™s _silent_tools_ project**, which serves a similar purpose for working with data within the Rosetta molecular modeling suite. However, a key distinction is that Quiver files are intentionally designed to be **platform-agnostic** and can be used in environments **outside of Rosetta**. This makes them especially valuable for more general-purpose data handling, sharing, and processing workflows across a broader range of scientific and software contexts.

## How to install

```bash
uv pip install quiver-pdb
```

## How to use

```bash
# make a quiver file
qvfrompdbs *.pdb > my.qv

# ask what's in a quiver file
qvls my.qv

# ask how many things are in a quiver file
qvls my.qv | wc -l

# extract all pdbs from a quiver file
qvextract my.qv

# extract the first 10 pdbs from a quiver file
qvls my.qv | head -n 10 | qvextractspecific my.qv

# extract a random 10 pdbs from a quiver file
# `qvextractspecific` reads tags from command-line arguments, or from stdin if no tags are provided as arguments.
qvls my.qv | shuf | head -n 10 | qvextractspecific my.qv

# extract a specific pdb from a quiver file
qvextractspecific my.qv name_of_pdb_0001

# produce a scorefile from a quiver file (e.g., my.qv will produce my.csv)
# The command will print a success message indicating the path to the generated CSV file.
qvscorefile my.qv

# combine qv files
cat 1.qv 2.qv 3.qv > my.qv

# ensure all pdbs in quiver file have unique names (example: make all tags start with "pdb_")
# Note: `qvrename` modifies the file in-place.
# The new tags must be provided, matching the number of existing tags.
# Example: if my.qv has 3 tags, you could do:
#   (echo "pdb_tag1"; echo "pdb_tag2"; echo "pdb_tag3") | qvrename my.qv
# Or, more realistically, generate new names with a script:
#   qvls my.qv | awk '{print "pdb_"NR}' | qvrename my.qv
# If you want to keep the original and save to a new file, copy it first:
#   cp my.qv uniq.qv && qvls uniq.qv | awk '{print "pdb_"NR}' | qvrename uniq.qv

# split a quiver file into groups of 100
qvsplit my.qv 100

# slice a quiver file
qvslice big.qv <tag1> <tag2> ... <tagN> > smaller.qv
```

## Testing

To run the test suite, execute the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

This will run both Rust unit tests and Python integration tests.

## Performance

The core logic of Quiver tools is implemented in Rust, leveraging its performance characteristics for file I/O and data manipulation. This generally results in faster execution compared to pure Python implementations, especially for large Quiver files or numerous operations. The "Benchmark" section below provides a comparison.

## Benchmark

### pure python

```bash
uv run python test/benchmark.py
Time to create Quiver file: 0.2492 seconds
Time to list tags: 0.0591 seconds
Time to slice Quiver file (5 tags): 0.0610 seconds
Time to extract from sliced Quiver file (5 files): 0.0267 seconds
Time to extract all files (101 files): 0.9863 seconds
```
### rusting version

```bash
uv run python test/benchmark.py
Time to create Quiver file: 0.0468 seconds
Time to list tags: 0.0603 seconds
Time to slice Quiver file (5 tags): 0.0962 seconds
Time to extract from sliced Quiver file (5 files): 0.0281 seconds
Time to extract all files (101 files): 0.4660 seconds
